## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

This assignment was good to learn javascript. I learned how to use `forEach` method to loop through the array of `button` elements and add event listeners to each rating button. I also learned how to use `classList` to add and remove classes to the elements. I also designed the layout using flexbox and implemented the mobile-first workflow.
