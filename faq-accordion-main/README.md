### What I learned

Completing this challenge introduced me to JavaScript for the first time in FEM, deepening my understanding of web development. I learned how to use JavaScript (I know JS but using it after doing few projects in REACT was fun :smiley: ) to create interactive features like the hide/show functionality in the FAQ accordion. Additionally, I honed my CSS skills to fine-tune the layout and design.

Also JavaScript is amazing language and it makes any challenge FUN :smile: , I love JS.
