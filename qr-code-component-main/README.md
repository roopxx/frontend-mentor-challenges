### What I Learned

I've always been eager to solidify my CSS knowledge, and I've been learning full-stack web development from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), which is the absolute best resource with a great community I've ever found. As an Odinate, the key lesson taught there is that to master anything, practice is essential. So, I searched for a platform where I could practice my CSS and design skills, and that's where [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) comes in. This was my first challenge, and it was relatively easy as it involved basic CSS. I'm looking forward to completing more challenges.

Additionally, I will submit all my challenges in this [repository](https://github.com/roopxx/frontend-mentor-challenges) and will strive to keep it updated as I continue learning by completing more challenges.
