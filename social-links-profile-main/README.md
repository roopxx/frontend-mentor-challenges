### What I Learned

This challenge was my third Frontend Mentor challenge, and it has significantly contributed to enhancing my CSS skills. One of the key learnings from this project was the importance of utilizing the all selector `*` to adjust margins and padding according to the design specifications (I forgot about resetting the defaults in previous challenges). This experience has helped me identify and address blind spots in my CSS knowledge, making my skills more robust.
